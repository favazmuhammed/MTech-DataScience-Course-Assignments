Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a national holiday in India commemorating the nation's independence 
from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the 1947 Indian Independence Act, which transferred 
legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly, came into effect. India retained King George VI as head of 
state until its transition to a republic, when the nation adopted the Constitution of India on 26 January 1950 
(celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign 
law Constitution of India. India attained independence following the Independence Movement noted for largely non-violent 
resistance and civil disobedience. It was on 15th August 1947 that India was declared independent from British colonialism, 
and the reins of control were handed over to the leaders of the Country.The Red Fort in Dehli is also an important 
Independence Day symbol in India as it is where Indian Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru unveiled India's flag on 
August 15, 1947. At midnight between 14/08/1947 and 15/08/1947 free India's first prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru 
gave his famous "Tryst with Destiny" speech. Colonial powers were transferred to India on August 15, 1947. The Constituent 
Assembly, to who power was to be transferred, met to celebrate India's independence at 11pm on August 14, 1947. India gained 
its liberty and became a free country at midnight between August 14 and August 15, 1947.
