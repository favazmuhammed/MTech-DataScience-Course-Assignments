it had to evacuate all its military units including its portion of the Black Sea Fleet out of the 
Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol]. A Russian construction project to re-home to fleet 
in Novorossiysk launched in 2005 and was expected to be fully completed by 2020; as of 2010, the project 
faced major budget cuts and construction delays. On 21 April 2010, former Ukrainian president Viktor 
Yanukovych signed a new dealm known as the Kharkiv Pact, to resolve the 2009 Russiaâ€“Ukraine gas dispute; 
it extended the stay until 2042 with an option to renew and in return receiving some discount on gas delivered 
from Russian.

Russia's decision to annex Crimea was made on 20 February 2014. On 22 and 23 February, Russian troops and special 
forces began moving into Crimea through Novorossiysk. On 27 February, Russian forces without insignias began 
taking control of the Crimean Peninsula. They took hold of strategic positions and captured the Crimean Parliament, 
raising a Russian flag. Security checkpoints were used to cut the Crimean Peninsula off from the rest of Ukraine and to 
restrict movement within the territory.

On 24 August 2014, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko referred to the anti-terrorist operation (ATO) as Ukraine's 
"Patriotic War of 2014" and a war against "external aggression". The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine 
labeled the conflict an invasion on 27 August 2014.The same day, Amvrosiivka was occupied by Russian paratroopers,
supported by 250 armoured vehicles and artillery pieces. Ten Russian paratroopers of the 331st Guards Airborne 
Regiment, military unit 71211 from Kostroma, were captured in Dzerkalne that day, a village near Amvrosiivka, 20 kilometres 
(12 mi) from the border, after their armoured vehicles were hit by Ukrainian artillery. On 25 August, the Security 
Service of Ukraine reported about the captured paratroopers, claiming they've crossed Ukrainian border in the night of 
23 August. The SBU also released their photos and names. The next day, the Russian Ministry of Defence said that 
they had crossed the border "by accident".
